Arduino RDA5807M Library

This library is intended for use with the RDA Microelectronics RDA5807M
single-chip broadcast FM radio receiver, as available on breakout boards
including the 32768Hz quartz crystal. Other chips in the family, such as
the RDA5807P or RDA5807HS, have a compatible register file and this library
should work with all of them.

To the furthest extent that this is legally possible, the fork maintained by
Radu - Eosif Mihailescu and published here https://github.com/csdexter/RDA5807M
is hereby released under the LGPL version 3.
To the furthest extent that this is legally enforceable, the copyright remains
with the authors listed above.

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

HARDWARE NOTES:
 * The RDA5807M is a 3.3V I/O chip whereas the Arduino Uno/Mega are 5V I/O. This
   means you will need to use a proper logic level shifter if you are trying to
   use the Breakout Board version with the latter. On the same vein,
   since the chip is I2C-only, you'll need a dedicated shifter such as the
   SparkFun BOB-11955 to communicate with it from a 5V I/O device.
 * Quick connection reference:
   I2C Mode, RDA5807M -> Arduino:
     SDIO      -> SDA     (Arduino bidirectional)
     SCLK      -> SCL     (Arduino output)
